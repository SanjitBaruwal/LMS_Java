The Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to
streamline the management of books, members, and transactions in a library. As part of
our On-the-Job Training (OJT) in Java, we developed this project to apply object-
oriented programming (OOP) principles, file handling, and data structures in a real-
world scenario.

In many traditional libraries, maintaining records manually is time-consuming and 
prone to errors. The LMS automates the process of issuing and returning books,
tracking due dates, and managing book and member details efficiently. By using Java,
we implemented features such as adding new books and members, issuing books to 
members, returning books, and displaying all records in a structured format. 

This project utilizes collections (Array List) to store books and member data 
dynamically, and file handling techniques to save and retrieve data persistently. 
The use of serialization ensures that the data remains intact even after the program is closed.
Additionally, the project follows object-oriented design, making it modular, reusable, 
and easy to maintain. 

Through this OJT, we gained hands-on experience in Java programming, problem-
solving, and system design. We learned the importance of structured coding, handling 
real-world data operations, and implementing user-friendly interfaces. The Library
Management System is a foundational project that helped us understand how software
applications manage real-world tasks efficiently. 

This report details the project's objectives, system design, implementation, and key 
takeaways from our learning experience.
