The Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to
streamline the management of books, members, and transactions in a library. As part of
our On-the-Job Training (OJT) in Java, we developed this project to apply object-
oriented programming (OOP) principles, file handling, and data structures in a real-
world scenario.

In many traditional libraries, maintaining records manually is time-consuming and 
prone to errors. The LMS automates the process of issuing and returning books,
tracking due dates, and managing book and member details efficiently. By using Java,
we implemented features such as adding new books and members, issuing books to 
members, returning books, and displaying all records in a structured format. 

This project utilizes collections (Array List) to store books and member data 
dynamically, and file handling techniques to save and retrieve data persistently. 
The use of serialization ensures that the data remains intact even after the program is closed.
Additionally, the project follows object-oriented design, making it modular, reusable, 
and easy to maintain. 

Through this OJT, we gained hands-on experience in Java programming, problem-
solving, and system design. We learned the importance of structured coding, handling 
real-world data operations, and implementing user-friendly interfaces. The Library
Management System is a foundational project that helped us understand how software
applications manage real-world tasks efficiently. 

This report details the project's objectives, system design, implementation, and key 
takeaways from our learning experience.


**PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS & MINI PROJECT**
During the training, I worked on a mini-project titled "Library Management System (LMS)", which is a Java-based application designed to manage books, members, and transactions in a library. This project provided an opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge I acquired during the training in a real-world scenario, helping me enhance my problem-solving, critical thinking, and debugging skills.
The Library Management System is an essential tool that automates various library operations, such as adding books and members, issuing books, returning books, and tracking due dates. Traditionally, libraries rely on manual record-keeping, which is often inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors. By developing this project, I was able to understand how digital solutions improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility in managing library resources.
The project was built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, ensuring a modular, reusable, and maintainable code structure. I implemented collections (ArrayList) to store book and member data dynamically, which made the system efficient in handling multiple records. Additionally, I used file handling and serialization to ensure that book and member details were stored persistently, even after the program was closed.
One of the key challenges I faced during development was implementing the book issuance and return process while ensuring data integrity. Through debugging and logical problem-solving, I successfully handled scenarios such as checking book availability, preventing duplicate issues, and maintaining accurate transaction records.
Overall, this project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in Java programming, enhance my debugging skills, and understand the real-world application of software development in library management. It also reinforced the importance of structured coding, efficient data handling, and user-friendly system design, which are crucial in software development.
